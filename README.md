# Frontend Battle 2.0 Pro

"Frontend Battle 2.0 Pro" is an enhanced, multi-page web project showcasing modern frontend development practices, responsive design, and aesthetic appeal. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it serves as a robust foundation for various web applications, from corporate websites to portfolio showcases.

* **Responsive Design:** Ensures seamless user experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones) using flexible layouts and media queries.
* **Modern Aesthetic:** A sleek, dark-themed design with subtle gradients, animations, and interactive elements for a polished look.
